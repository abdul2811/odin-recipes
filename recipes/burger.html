    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The classic burger stands as an iconic symbol of delightful simplicity in the world of gastronomy. At its core, this recipe champions a perfectly grilled beef patty seasoned with just the right blend of salt and pepper. Placed between two lightly toasted buns, the juiciness of the meat is complemented by the crispy freshness of lettuce, the tangy sweetness of ripe tomatoes, and the mild bite of thinly-sliced onions. A swipe of creamy mayonnaise and a squirt of tangy mustard elevate the flavors, making each bite a harmonious medley of tastes and textures. Paired with a side of golden, crispy fries and a chilled beverage, this burger offers an unbeatable, timeless satisfaction that resonates with both the young and the old. Whether at a backyard barbecue or a chic urban eatery, it's a testament to the fact that some classics never go out of style.</p>
