    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna, a staple of Italian cuisine, is a layered pasta dish that combines rich flavors and hearty ingredients into a comforting and savory casserole. This recipe focuses on the classic version, incorporating tender sheets of lasagna noodles layered between a robust and tangy tomato-based meat sauce, creamy b√©chamel, and a generous sprinkling of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. As the dish bakes, the cheese melts to form a golden crust on top, while the interior remains lusciously soft and moist. The aroma of herbs like basil and oregano waft through the air, promising a delectable meal that evokes the warmth of an Italian kitchen. Serve it hot with some garlic bread and a crisp salad, and you have a meal fit for both weeknight dinners and special occasions.</p>
